## 1. Implementation
- [x] 1.1 Review current platform handling in cargo-buckal and buckal-bundles; capture gaps versus desired multi-platform behavior.
- [x] 1.2 Implement Tier1 host OS model + mapping helpers (Tier1 triples incl. `aarch64-apple-darwin`) in `cargo-buckal/src/platform.rs`.
- [ ] 1.2b Add unit tests for triple→OS mapping and cfg matching.
- [x] 1.3 Parse target-specific dependency clauses using `cargo_platform::Platform` + `rustc --print=cfg` snapshots to derive per‑OS sets.
- [ ] 1.3b Add unit tests for cfg parsing and os_deps/os_named_deps expansion.
- [x] 1.4 Emit `os_deps`/`os_named_deps` for guarded deps during buckify generation; keep allowlist-based `compatible_with` for known OS‑only crates.
- [ ] 1.4b Include platform model revision in cache fingerprints (or bump cache version when SUPPORTED_TARGETS/PACKAGE_PLATFORMS change).
- [x] 1.5 Extend buckal-bundles rust_* wrapper rules to accept `os_deps` and `os_named_deps`, expanding them to `select()` with a DEFAULT branch.
- [x] 1.6 Add sample workspace/tests (test/3rd/fd + CI harness) covering windows‑only and unix‑only deps; validate via cross‑platform build or `buck2 --target-platforms`.
- [x] 1.6b Fix cross‑compile label mismatch by switching OS labels to `prelude//os/constraints:*` in both generator and bundles.
- [ ] 1.7 Update docs (e.g., doc/buckal_intro.md and a platform guide) and run formatting plus `openspec validate add-multi-platform-support --strict`.
